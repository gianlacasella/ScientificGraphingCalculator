# SCIENTIFIC PLOTTING CALCULATOR

A Python script that I wrote to learn (self-taught) to use Tkinter module. The program is a scientific/plotting calculator.
The plotting frame was made with matplotlib module.

# What I learned

* Managing windows with Tkinter: mainloop, PhotoImage and other properties
* Managing Tkinter tools such as Frames, Buttons, Fonts, Entries, Labels, Spinboxes, ScrollBars, StringVars and their properties
* Learned some Python's functions such as exec(), eval() and lambda functions
* Learned to add Matplotlib's Figures, Plots and Toolbars into a Tkinter Frame

# How should you run this script

Just clone this repo, open a Terminal inside the folder (on linux) and type one of this options:
	
	make run: run the script
	make clean: clean up Python's cache
	make all: run and clean

Remember to install before:

	Python 3.6
	Numpy
	Tkinter
	Scipy
	Matplotlib
