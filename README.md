# Scientific Graphing Calculator

A Python program that I wrote to learn (self-taught) to use Tkinter. The program is a scientific/plotting calculator, powered by
Tkinter, matplotlib and numpy.

## Getting started

There are two ways to execute this program:

1. You can clone/download this repository and open a command prompt / bash inside the downloaded folder. Then, just type in:
```
	python main.py
```

2. You can download my last release on this repository, and run scientificCalculator.exe on Windows

## Prerequisites

If you want to execute the program in the first way, you will need to have installed before:
* Python 3.6
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Tkinter

## What I learned

* Managing windows with Tkinter
* Managing Tkinter tools
* Learned some Python's functions such as exec(), eval() and lambda functions
* Learned to add Matplotlib's Figures, Plots and Toolbars into a Tkinter Frame
